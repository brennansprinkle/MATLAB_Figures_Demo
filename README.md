The file `basic_plotting.m 
slowly adds ideas to an initally bad plot to eventually make it:
- colorsafe 
- easily readible 
- nice looking

The file `loop_plot.m`
gives an example of how to use color spaces (e.g plasma) to 
communicate order (sequence) in multiple plots on the same figgure

The file `ThreeD_plotting.m`
explores a bit of 3D plotting and how coices of colorspace (e.g jet)
can dramatically distort or highlight certian data.
